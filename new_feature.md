Though this project looks like nothing was added since last week, it was edited to add several features until the addition of one feature sent the code back to the beginning. One feature I had added in to my drawing canvas was a text box that the user could place and type into. Once that was complete I had Chat GTP edit the code so that the text box could have customizable text color and fonts, a reasonable request for a drawing software creating a custom image. The canvas was intended to have you put in a text box which it could do and there would then be a drop down and color wheel to edit the appearence of the text. When prometed with this, Chat GPT added in a dropdown and color wheel but removed all other buttons and drawing tools I had previously added. I asked it to reimplement those tools but when it did it also removed the customization for the text box, made the user stuck on pasting only text boxs into the canvas once selected, and made the buttons for other tools useless. After a couple more attemps to fix the code I recieved messeges from Chat saying that it attempted to restore those features but it made no edits to the code.
